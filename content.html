<p>Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers by splitting them into two parts: a number between 1 and 10, and a power of ten.</p>
    
<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>3,000 can be written in scientific notation as $3 \times 10^{3}$.</li>
    <li>0.00042 can be expressed as $4.2 \times 10^{-4}$.</li>
    <li>602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 can be written in scientific notation as $6.022 \times 10^{23}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number before the $\times$ (the coefficient) is always a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, while the power of ten (the exponent) indicates how many times the coefficient should be multiplied by 10 (for positive exponents) or divided by 10 (for negative exponents).</p>

<p>Scientific notation is particularly useful for representing very large or very small numbers compared to standard decimal notation. Scientific notation is more compact and obviously shows their magnitude without having to count the number of numerals present.</p>
