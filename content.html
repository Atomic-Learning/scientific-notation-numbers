<p>Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers by splitting them into two parts: a number between 1 and 10, and a power of ten. This format is especially useful for representing very large or very small numbers in a more manageable way.</p>
    
<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 can be written in scientific notation as $6.022 \times 10^{23}$.</li>
    <li>0.00042 can be expressed as $4.2 \times 10^{-4}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number before the $\times$ (the coefficient) is always a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, while the power of ten (the exponent) indicates how many times the coefficient should be multiplied by 10 (for positive exponents) or divided by 10 (for negative exponents).</p>
